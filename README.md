### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Naim, Frontend developer from **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a federated identity management system. That's all I can say ðŸ¤«
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning backend technologies and have developed my first full-stack application called **Dosa-Aksara.**
  It utilizes Remix JS for the frontend, Node.js for the API, and PostgreSQL for the database, all of which are deployed on Docker
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-naim-bin-roslan/) 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I code personal project sometimes, just to chill out and take a break from work coding
